# [EN] Virtual Reallity and Optical Measuring with Image Reconstruct
thanks for reading. In this project, i looked for anwers to 'How is runnig Virtual Reallity systems ?' and 'How can i measure a real object's centimetres size with one camera ?'. When i searching this answers i found <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html">Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction</a> topic in opencv Documentations and i was searched more documentation about this topic (the documentations and mine ImageReconstruct library codes in my  <a href="https://github.com/umutkaanbaser/imagereconstruct">ImageReconstruct</a> repo). 


I tried add a cube has real centimetres measures to 2d image and I tried measure real centimetre to distance between two 2d points in image. You can look this videos.
